/*
EXECUTION ORDER QUIZ:

====== OPTION 1 ======
Hiiii
Welcome to loupe
I will run after 1 second
Expensive operation done

====== OPTION 2 ======
Hiiii
Welcome to loupe
Expensive operation done
I will run after 1 second

====== OPTION 2 IS CORRECT âœ“ ======
Why? Run it on Loupe - pta chal jayega kyu!

Reason: setTimeout callback waits in callback queue until call stack is empty.
The expensive loop blocks the main thread, so callback executes only after loop completes.
